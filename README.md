## Integrating Public Transport Data with Financial Trading Trends

### Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate public transport usage data with financial trading datasets to gain insights for urban development analysis. This integration can help identify correlations between public transport demands and financial market activities, aiding in informed decision-making for urban infrastructure planning.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting data visualizations.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   
2. **Install Required Packages**
   Use pip to install the required Python packages:
   bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   

### Usage
1. **Prepare Your Datasets**
   - Ensure you have the public transport and financial trading datasets available in CSV and XLSX formats, respectively.
   - Place them in the root directory of the cloned repository.

2. **Run the Example Code**
   - Execute the Python script to perform the analysis and visualize the results:
   bash
   python integrate_analysis.py
   

### Results
- The script will merge the datasets based on the 'date' column and plot a graph showing the correlation between public transport ridership and financial trading volumes.

### Customization
- Modify the script to explore other relationships or to handle different dataset structures as needed.
